# PhoneBookAPI

# Your Task:
* Create a WEB APP using **Angular**

## Requirements:
* 1. The UI should be responsive
* 2. The APP should display all the data for each entry in the phone book(api database)
* 3. You should be able to make get/post/put/delete requests from the Web App that will effect the DB and those changes should be reflected in the APP itself
* 4. Add validation on the client side to inform the user that a **name** and a **number** are required when submitting a new entry or changing one.(The API will not accept entries without a name and a number)

# To run:
*   Open the runapi.bat file or open a command terminal and navigate to the directory with server.js and run "node server.js"

# The Api routes
*   /get - to get all the entries
*   /get/:id - to get just one entry with that specific id
*   /post - to post a new entry into the database
*   /delete/:id - to delete an entry from the database with that specific id
*   /put - to edit an entry in the database

**Note:** The database is in memory so on each restart of the server/api the db data will be reset to the default values.
**Note:** The Server runs on port 3000. (So you should sent requests to Example: http://localhost:3000/get)
